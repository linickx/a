Install Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This hopefully should be quite straight forward.

(1) Unpack php-ices into your webservers root.
(2) Create a temp directory in php-ices. Something like /var/www/html/php-ices/temp
(3) Make the temp directory writeable to the webserever process. Something like chmod 666 /var/www/html/php-ices/temp or chown apache /var/www/html/php-ices/temp
(4) Edit config php to meet your needs ;-) At the very least set the stream password on line 31 !
(5) Point your Web browser at php-ices !

Good Luck :-D,
